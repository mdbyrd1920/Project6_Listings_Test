# Project6_Listings_Test

(Test Driven Development) 

The Project6_Listings_Test demonstrates my ability to create test cases with PHP Unit using an existing application. 

# How to setup on local machine


Place the repo in a web server of your choice (XAMPP for Windows, MAMP for Mac)

Install PHP(version must be match with the web server's php version), composer. You can refer to https://getcomposer.org/download/ for the process.

Open a terminal under the folder and type in "composer install"

Then "composer update"

Then type "vendor/bin/phpunit tests" to see all the test results
